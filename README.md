This project is based on a dictionary containing hospital data points
from the CMS API, fields are based on CMS standard terminology. A class was written to allow access to the fields in 
each dictionary. In addition there are methods included in the class that allow the data to be downloaded. 
In addition to the class, there are helper functions written for data normalization and cleaning
as well as functions written for accessing and writing data to the MySQL database 
running on the AWS instance.
